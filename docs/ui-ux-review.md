# UI/UX Review (Playwright Screenshot Pass)

Date: 2026-02-12/13

This review is based on the automated screenshot run in `artifacts/ui/latest/` generated by `scripts/ui-snapshots.mjs` across:
- Routes: Hub (`/`), Slopcast (`/slopcast`)
- Views: DESIGN (builder/dashboard), SCENARIOS (analysis)
- Themes: `slate` (modern), `mario` (classic)
- Viewports: desktop `1440x900`, mobile `390x844`

## What’s Working Well

- Modern (Slate) theme feels coherent: consistent dark surfaces, controlled neon accents, readable type, and good “card” hierarchy.
- Hub page has a strong first impression: clear headline, obvious primary CTA, and the top-right theme switcher is a nice “system-level” affordance.
- Data density on desktop Slopcast is solid: left “setup” column, center “workspace”, right KPIs and charts reads like an ops console.
- Classic (Mario) theme has a more intentional palette than the older brown-dominant look: sand canvas + navy modules is a better base.
- Container system is mostly consistent in the primary screens (outer cards vs inner tiles), which makes the UI feel “designed” rather than assembled.

## Primary Flaws (UX + Visual Consistency)

### 1) Header Interaction/Overlap Risk

The screenshot automation currently uses forced clicks for header controls (`scripts/ui-snapshots.mjs` uses `{ force: true }` on hub->slopcast and theme/tab clicks). That’s a strong indicator the header has overlap or pointer interception under some widths/wrap states.

Why it matters:
- It can cause “dead” or unreliable click targets for real users.
- It makes visual QA less trustworthy because tests are bypassing hit-testing.

### 2) Uneven “Container Contracts” Across the App

Even with shared radii, some surfaces still feel uneven because the “contract” varies:
- Different padding scales inside similarly ranked cards.
- Border opacity and shadow weight vary within the same tier.
- Mixed rounding families in a few places (e.g., `rounded-lg`/`rounded` showing up alongside `rounded-panel`).

Net effect:
- Cards read as different “systems” instead of one UI language.

### 3) Mobile Information Architecture: Too Much Vertical Work

On mobile, the main views become a long scroll of cards with no “mode-level” framing:
- DESIGN becomes a sequence of blocks where the user loses context (what’s primary, what’s optional, what is currently actionable).
- SCENARIOS becomes especially scroll-heavy, and key controls (variable selectors) sit far from the visualization they affect.

### 4) Weak/Empty-State Areas Reduce Perceived Quality

The “Portfolio Overlay” card in SCENARIOS often reads as empty (or ambiguous) relative to its size.

Net effect:
- It looks unfinished.
- Users don’t know what action populates it.

### 5) Classic Theme: High Saturation Everywhere

Classic is fun, but it’s “always loud”:
- Red titlebars, bright KPI fills, and heavy contrasts compete everywhere.
- On mobile, the classic chrome feels especially overpowering.

Net effect:
- Harder to scan.
- Makes the UI feel less premium, more arcade.

## Recommendations (Prioritized, Actionable)

### P0 (Fix First)

- Remove the need for forced clicks in header automation.
  - Make header layout deterministic across wrap states.
  - Ensure no invisible overlays intercept pointer events.
  - Goal: delete `{ force: true }` for theme/tab clicks in `scripts/ui-snapshots.mjs` and keep the run stable.

- Establish a strict “card tier system” and enforce it.
  - Tier A: primary panels (outer cards) use one padding scale, one border opacity, one shadow.
  - Tier B: nested tiles use one padding scale, no competing shadows, and lighter borders.
  - Goal: when two cards are siblings, they should look like siblings.

- Mobile restructure for Slopcast screens.
  - Add a sticky mode-level switcher (DESIGN/SCENARIOS) plus a secondary section switcher (e.g., Setup, Workspace, KPIs).
  - Convert low-frequency blocks into collapsible sections on mobile (accordion).
  - Goal: reduce scroll length and improve “where am I” clarity.

### P1 (High Value Polish)

- Improve empty states.
  - Portfolio Overlay: show a short explanation and a small preview skeleton of what it will display.
  - Deal Memo: when disabled, show “why” (e.g., “Assign wells to a group to enable analysis”).

- Rebalance Hub layout.
  - Reduce “right column emptiness” by stacking Account + Quick Actions as one vertical rail with aligned spacing.
  - Make “App Navigation” tiles more uniform (button placement, status badge placement, and consistent body text length handling).

- Classic theme: introduce “Classic Lite” rules (even if it’s just internal).
  - Default most titlebars to neutral, reserve red/yellow/blue for semantic emphasis.
  - Reduce KPI fill intensity slightly; use color as accent, not background fill everywhere.

### P2 (Quality + Accessibility)

- Ensure focus states are visible and not clipped on all controls (tabs, theme buttons, select inputs).
- Verify contrast for muted text, especially on Slate where borders and muted labels can get close.
- Add a “reduced motion” consideration if blur/glow animations become heavier over time.

## Visual QA Workflow (Playwright)

- Generate a full screenshot pass: `npm run ui:shots`
- Run a quick drift audit: `node scripts/ui-audit.mjs`
- Review diffs:
  - If you keep screenshots in `artifacts/ui/latest/`, compare before/after runs by filename and theme/view/viewport.

Definition of done for UI changes:
- Desktop + mobile screenshots look intentional (no accidental wrap/overlaps).
- Slate and Mario both remain readable and consistent.
- No “ad-hoc” containers reintroduced (stick to the shared card primitives).
