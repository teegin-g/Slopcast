# Slopcast Multi-Agent Development System

## Overview

This system separates **implementation** from **validation** to prevent coding agents from breaking the app during agentic development. It uses git worktrees for isolation and a structured supervisor-coordinated pipeline.

## Roles

| Role | File | Responsibility |
|------|------|---------------|
| **Supervisor** | `roles/supervisor.md` | Decompose requests, create worktrees, coordinate agents, merge results |
| **Implementer** | `roles/implementer.md` | Build features in isolated worktrees, follow project conventions |
| **Validator** | `roles/validator.md` | Run validation gate, generate pass/fail reports |

## Workflows

| Workflow | File | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| **Feature Pipeline** | `workflows/feature-pipeline.md` | Full request → plan → implement → validate → merge cycle |
| **Worktree Lifecycle** | `workflows/worktree-lifecycle.md` | Create / work / validate / merge / cleanup operations |

## Validation Gate

The validation gate (`validation/gate.sh`) is a fail-fast pipeline:

1. **Type safety** — `npm run typecheck`
2. **Production build** — `npm run build`
3. **Unit tests** — `npm test`
4. **Style drift** — `npm run ui:audit`
5. **Screenshot diff** — Capture + compare against baseline (>1% pixel diff = failure)
6. **UI flow validation** — `npm run ui:verify`

## Usage Modes

### Automated (Supervisor-Orchestrated)
The supervisor handles everything end-to-end. User reviews final result.

### Manual (Step-Through)
1. `/supervisor` — plans and creates worktrees, then pauses
2. `/implement` — implements one task in a specific worktree
3. `/validate` — runs validation gate against a worktree
4. User tells supervisor to merge (or does it manually)

## Tool Adapters

| Tool | Adapter | Invocation |
|------|---------|------------|
| **Claude Code** | `adapters/claude-code/` | `/supervisor`, `/implement`, `/validate` skills |
| **Cursor** | `adapters/cursor/` | Load `.cursorrules`, invoke roles via Composer |
| **Codex** | `adapters/codex/` | `codex --agent supervisor` (or `implementer`/`validator`) |

## Activity Logging

All agents log structured events to `.agents/state/activity.jsonl` using the logging script:

```bash
bash .agents/activity-log.sh <event> [key=value ...]
```

### Event Types

| Event | Logged By | Description |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| `session_start` | Supervisor | Session begins |
| `task_created` | Supervisor | Task decomposed and brief created |
| `worktree_created` | Supervisor | Worktree created for a task |
| `worktree_verified` | Implementer | Implementer confirmed they're in a worktree |
| `implementation_start` | Implementer | Coding begins |
| `implementation_done` | Implementer | Coding complete, self-checks passed |
| `validation_start` | Validator/gate.sh | Validation gate starts |
| `validation_done` | Validator | Validation complete |
| `gate_result` | gate.sh | Gate pass/fail with stage counts |
| `merge_start` | Supervisor | About to merge a worktree |
| `merge_result` | Supervisor | Merge succeeded or failed |
| `worktree_cleaned` | Supervisor | Worktree removed |
| `session_end` | Supervisor | Session complete |

### Reading the Log

```bash
bash .agents/activity-summary.sh                 # All events, formatted table
bash .agents/activity-summary.sh --task {slug}    # Filter by task
cat .agents/state/activity.jsonl                  # Raw JSONL
```

### Validation Records

The gate script writes structured JSON records to `.agents/state/validations/{task}-{timestamp}.json` with per-stage results.

## Key Directories

- `.agents/state/` — Ephemeral session state (gitignored)
- `.agents/state/baseline/` — Screenshot baseline from main
- `.agents/state/activity.jsonl` — Activity log (JSONL format)
- `.agents/state/validations/` — Structured validation records (JSON)
- `.worktrees/` — Git worktrees for isolated work (gitignored)

## Model Configuration (Databricks Proxy)

This project routes API calls through a Databricks proxy. When spawning agents with the `Agent` tool, **always include `model: "opus"` or `model: "sonnet"`**. Without an explicit model alias, spawned agents receive the raw model ID (e.g. `claude-opus-4-6`) which fails silently against the Databricks endpoint. The alias triggers env var resolution (`ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_OPUS_MODEL`) to the correct Databricks-specific model name.

```
# CORRECT — alias resolves to databricks-claude-opus-4-6
Agent(model: "opus", ...)

# WRONG — raw ID fails on Databricks proxy
Agent(...)
```

This applies to all agent spawning: `Agent` tool, `team_name` teammates, worktree agents.

## Project Conventions

All agents MUST follow `CLAUDE.md` in the repo root. Key rules:
- Break refactors and broad multi-file work into phases of no more than 5 files, and wait for explicit approval before the next phase
- For work touching more than 5 independent files, split the work across parallel agents or worktrees
- Re-read files before and after edits, and narrow/re-run commands when output looks truncated
- Do not signal completion until required verification succeeds, including `npm run typecheck` and `npx eslint . --quiet` when ESLint is configured
- Read existing patterns before writing new code
- Use `rounded-panel` for outer cards, `rounded-inner` for nested tiles
- All types in `src/types.ts`, interfaces PascalCase
- Run `npm run typecheck` before signaling completion
