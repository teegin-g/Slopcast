# Worker Assignment: worker-1

**Team:** wave-1-for-slopcast-ui-stabili
**Role:** executor
**Worker Name:** worker-1

## Your Assigned Tasks

- **Task 1**: Implement: Wave 1 for Slopcast UI stabilization. Use 3 workers with explicit own
  Description: Implement the core functionality for: Wave 1 for Slopcast UI stabilization. Use 3 workers with explicit ownership. Worker 1 owns mobile Wells layout in src/components/slopcast/DesignWellsView.tsx, src/components/slopcast/hooks/useViewportLayout.ts, and only narrow caller updates in src/pages/SlopcastPage.tsx if needed. Goal: 390x844 Wells on 127.0.0.1:3100 must use the intended mobile flow with no clipped header, no desktop split rail dominating the viewport, and no white gutter. Worker 2 owns OverlayToolbar contract cleanup and touch target hardening in src/components/slopcast/map/OverlayToolbar.tsx and src/components/slopcast/map/OverlayToolbar.stories.tsx. Goal: Databricks source story is truthful and mobile hit areas are at least 44px without bloating desktop density. Worker 3 owns baseline verification only: run npm run ui:components, npm run ui:verify, npm run ui:audit, and collect Playwright screenshots and exact failures against 127.0.0.1:3100 and Storybook iframe. All workers: you are not alone in the codebase, do not revert others work, stay inside your write scope, and report blockers clearly.

## Instructions

1. Load and follow the worker skill from the first existing path:
   - `${CODEX_HOME:-~/.codex}/skills/worker/SKILL.md`
   - `/Users/teegingroves/Programming/Slopcast/.codex/skills/worker/SKILL.md`
   - `/Users/teegingroves/Programming/Slopcast/skills/worker/SKILL.md` (repo fallback)
2. Send startup ACK to the lead mailbox BEFORE any task work (run this exact command):

   `omx team api send-message --input "{"team_name":"wave-1-for-slopcast-ui-stabili","from_worker":"worker-1","to_worker":"leader-fixed","body":"ACK: worker-1 initialized"}" --json`

3. Start with the first non-blocked task
4. Resolve canonical team state root in this order: `OMX_TEAM_STATE_ROOT` env -> worker identity `team_state_root` -> config/manifest `team_state_root` -> local cwd fallback.
5. Read the task file for your selected task id at `/Users/teegingroves/Programming/Slopcast/.omx/state/team/wave-1-for-slopcast-ui-stabili/tasks/task-<id>.json` (example: `task-1.json`)
6. Task id format:
   - State/MCP APIs use `task_id: "<id>"` (example: `"1"`), not `"task-1"`.
7. Request a claim via CLI interop (`omx team api claim-task --json`) to claim it
8. Complete the work described in the task
9. After completing work, commit your changes before reporting completion:
   `git add -A && git commit -m "task: <task-subject>"`
   This ensures your changes are available for incremental integration into the leader branch.
10. Complete/fail it via lifecycle transition API (`omx team api transition-task-status --json`) from `"in_progress"` to `"completed"` or `"failed"` (include `result`/`error`)
11. Use `omx team api release-task-claim --json` only for rollback to `pending`
12. Write `{"state": "idle", "updated_at": "<current ISO timestamp>"}` to `/Users/teegingroves/Programming/Slopcast/.omx/state/team/wave-1-for-slopcast-ui-stabili/workers/worker-1/status.json`
13. Wait for the next instruction from the lead
14. For legacy team_* MCP tools (hard-deprecated), use `omx team api`; do not pass `workingDirectory` unless the lead explicitly asks (if resolution fails, use leader cwd: `/Users/teegingroves/Programming/Slopcast`)

## Mailbox Delivery Protocol (Required)
When you are notified about mailbox messages, always follow this exact flow:

1. List mailbox:
   `omx team api mailbox-list --input "{"team_name":"wave-1-for-slopcast-ui-stabili","worker":"worker-1"}" --json`
2. For each undelivered message, mark delivery:
   `omx team api mailbox-mark-delivered --input "{"team_name":"wave-1-for-slopcast-ui-stabili","worker":"worker-1","message_id":"<MESSAGE_ID>"}" --json`

Use terse ACK bodies (single line) for consistent parsing across Codex and Claude workers.
After any mailbox reply, continue executing your assigned work or the next feasible task; do not stop after sending the reply.

## Message Protocol
When using `omx team api send-message`, ALWAYS include from_worker with YOUR worker name:
- from_worker: "worker-1"
- to_worker: "leader-fixed" (for leader) or "worker-N" (for peers)

Example: omx team api send-message --input "{"team_name":"wave-1-for-slopcast-ui-stabili","from_worker":"worker-1","to_worker":"leader-fixed","body":"ACK: initialized"}" --json


## Verification Requirements

## Verification Protocol

Verify the following task is complete: each assigned task

### Required Evidence:

1. Run full type check (tsc --noEmit or equivalent)
2. Run test suite (focus on changed areas)
3. Run linter on modified files
4. Verify the feature/fix works end-to-end
5. Check for regressions in related functionality

Report: PASS/FAIL with command output for each check.

## Fix-Verify Loop

If verification fails:
1. Identify the root cause of each failure
2. Fix the issue (prefer minimal changes)
3. Re-run verification
4. Repeat up to 3 times
5. If still failing after 3 attempts, escalate with:
   - What was attempted
   - What failed and why
   - Recommended next steps

When marking completion, include structured verification evidence in your task result:
- `Verification:`
- One or more PASS/FAIL checks with command/output references


## Scope Rules
- Only edit files described in your task descriptions
- Do NOT edit files that belong to other workers
- If you need to modify a shared/common file, write `{"state": "blocked", "reason": "need to edit shared file X"}` to your status file and wait
- You may spawn Codex native subagents when parallel execution improves throughput.
- Use subagents only for independent, bounded subtasks that can run safely within this worker pane.
